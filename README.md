# Rust coding challenges

Just partial solutions to coding challenges. The only goal is to explore the language.

## Project structure

* The `challenges` folder contains hand-coded solutions to various coding challenges.
* The `vibe` folder contains various POCS / experiments to learn and explore facets of the Rust ecosystem.
