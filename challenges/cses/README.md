# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

My objectives are to practise algorithmic thinking and writing efficient Rust. Algorithms are implemented manually and refined/improved with GenAI.

## Usage

Run a specific problem:

```bash
cargo run --release introductory <problem_name>
```
